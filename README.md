- 👋 Hi, I’m @MECOJEDA or César Ojeda
- 👀 I’m interested in:
      Current technologies

      SAP technologies
      Spending time with my family
      Being outdoors

- 🌱 I’m currently learning
      Everything about SAP BTP
      INTEGRATION SUITE, SAP BAS
- 💞️ I'd love to collaborate on teaching programming classes,
      especially to help those with limited access to technology
      get involved in this exciting field
-     I'd like to collaborate on:
      Projects related to the technologies I'm proficient in: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, and SAP BTP.
